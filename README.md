This is a DIY mechanical keyboard project which is printable 
with a FDM printer.

3D models are written in OpenJSCAD. 
You can try it [here](http://openjscad.org/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinhwanlazy/3d-printable-keyboard/master/model.js)

I'm sorry for lack of explanation. I lost pictures which I took while building
the board. And also I lost my enthusiasm to update this repository since I switched to
my [second project](https://github.com/jinhwanlazy/wood-case-keyboard).
